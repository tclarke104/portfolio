Creating a Virtual Surgical Plan (VSP) is a multi-step process that integrates various digital tools to design a precise and customized surgical approach for each patient. This section provides a practical guide to getting started with VSP, covering the essential steps and tools needed to develop a successful plan.

The first step in creating a VSP is acquiring high-quality imaging data, typically through a CT scan. This imaging data serves as the foundation for the entire planning process. Once you have the CT scan, the next step is to import the data into a software platform capable of handling complex 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Slicer. 3D Slicer is a powerful, free tool widely used in medical imaging and surgical planning. It allows you to convert 2D CT images into detailed 3D models, which can then be manipulated to suit the specific requirements of the surgery.

After importing the CT scan into 3D Slicer, the process of segmentation begins. Segmentation involves isolating the relevant anatomical structures, such as the bones or soft tissues, from the surrounding anatomy. This step is crucial because the accuracy of your segmentation will directly influence the quality of the virtual surgical plan. 3D Slicer offers various tools and techniques to refine your segmentation, ensuring that the 3D model accurately represents the patient's anatomy.

Once segmentation is complete, the next phase involves creating additional models and planning the surgery itself. This is where tools like Meshmixer come into play. Meshmixer is particularly useful for refining the 3D models created in 3D Slicer and for adding any necessary modifications or additional structures to the model. This might include simulating resections, adding prosthetic components, or making adjustments to better fit the surgical needs.

To support this section, weâ€™ve included a video titled "Creating Additional Models and Planning in Meshmixer." This video provides a step-by-step demonstration of how to import your 3D models into Meshmixer, refine them, and create a detailed surgical plan. The tutorial focuses on the critical aspects of model manipulation and planning within Meshmixer, ensuring that you can confidently apply these techniques to your own cases.

This section serves as an overview of the steps involved in creating a virtual surgical plan, leading up to but not including the creation of cutting guides. Each of these steps will be explored in more detail during the hands-on portion of the course. By the end of this section, you should be comfortable using 3D Slicer and Meshmixer to create and refine models as part of your surgical planning process. The following section will dive into the creation of cutting guides, an essential component of executing your surgical plan with precision.
