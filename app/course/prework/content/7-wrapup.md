Thank you for taking the time to review the pre-course materials and familiarize yourself with the concepts and tools that will be covered in our upcoming session on Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP). We hope that this guide has provided you with a solid foundation in the key techniques and software used in VSP, including CT imaging, 3D reconstruction, surgical planning, cutting guide creation, and 3D printing with PreForm.

Our goal for this course is to equip you with the practical skills and knowledge needed to independently create and implement virtual surgical plans using free, accessible tools. By mastering these techniques, you’ll be able to enhance the precision and outcomes of your surgical procedures, ultimately improving patient care.

We’re excited to welcome you to the course and look forward to working with you hands-on. This session will be an excellent opportunity to apply what you’ve learned, ask questions, and troubleshoot any challenges you may encounter in real time.
