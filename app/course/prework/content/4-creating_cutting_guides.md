Cutting guides are an essential component of Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP), as they ensure that the surgical plan is executed with precision during the actual procedure. These guides are custom-designed templates that fit onto the patient’s anatomy and direct the surgeon’s instruments to the exact locations defined in the surgical plan. This section will walk you through the process of creating cutting guides, focusing on the tools and techniques required to produce accurate and effective guides.

Once you have completed the segmentation and planning stages in 3D Slicer and Meshmixer, the next step is to design cutting guides that will translate your virtual plan into the physical world. The primary tool used for this purpose is Meshmixer, a versatile software that allows for the precise design and manipulation of 3D models. In Meshmixer, you can create cutting guides that match the contours of the patient’s anatomy, ensuring a perfect fit during surgery.

The process begins with importing the 3D models from your previous work in 3D Slicer into Meshmixer. Using Meshmixer’s design tools, you can then create guide surfaces that align with the planned cuts. This involves defining the cutting planes, adding registration markers or slots, and ensuring that the guide is securely anchored to the anatomy. These features are crucial for maintaining stability and accuracy during the surgical procedure.

After designing the cutting guide in Meshmixer, the next step is to prepare it for 3D printing. This typically involves exporting the guide as an STL file, which can then be imported into a slicer software like PreForm. PreForm prepares the model for printing on a 3D printer, such as the Form 4B, by optimizing the print settings and generating the necessary support structures. The printed guide must be produced with a biocompatible material that is safe for use in the operating room.
Once the guide is printed, it undergoes sterilization before being used in surgery. During the procedure, the guide is placed on the patient’s anatomy, and the surgeon uses it to perform the planned cuts with high precision. The accuracy of the cutting guide is critical to the success of the surgery, as it ensures that the virtual plan is replicated exactly as intended.

This section is complemented by hands-on exercises in the course, where you will have the opportunity to design and print your own cutting guides using the techniques described. Additionally, we will explore common challenges and troubleshooting tips to help you refine your guide designs and improve their accuracy and functionality.

Creating cutting guides is a crucial skill in VSP, bridging the gap between virtual planning and real-world surgical execution. Mastering this process will enable you to perform surgeries with greater confidence and precision, leading to better outcomes for your patients.
